# Mock-DBMS
PHP-based web application interfacing with a MariaDB database for dynamic SQL queries on a mock grocery system hosted on a live campus server.

Due to campus account security reasons, credentials used to access dragon.csustan.edu (live campus server) MariaDB will be omitted from this repo.
