# Mock-DBMS
PHP-based web application interfacing with a MariaDB database for dynamic SQL queries on a mock grocery system hosted on a live campus server.

**Due to campus account security reasons, credentials used to access dragon.csustan.edu (live campus server) MariaDB will be omitted from this repo.**

FULL PROJECT DESC. -- Dr. Thomas:
CS 4250 Project Part 7
Demonstration: you must email me a link to your working website [https://dragon.csustan.edu/~resquerra] 

The goal of this part of the project is to interface your database with a programming language and to make it web-accessible. This is the stage where you embed your database into a complete application. The programming language that I recommend is PHP, a popular, server-side scripting language. (See the class lecture notes for more details about PHP.) PHP has been installed on the DBH 288 machines. Using PHP, the MariaDB database that you have created can be accessed via the web, using a webserver installed on dragon.csustan.edu. (Bear in mind that, due to recent security constraints, dragon.csustan.edu can only be reached if you are on-campus, either physically or virtually, with the assistance of a VPN.)
